# The Epoch of Babylon

## Description

When I was going through MogamBro's PC, I found something strange in his calendar application. Either he is a really
busy person with lots of scheduled reminders, or maybe he is hiding something. I suspect it's the latter. I've attached
the [file](timestamps.txt) containing the timestamps of all his reminders. Find out the secrets that MogamBro is hiding
within them.
